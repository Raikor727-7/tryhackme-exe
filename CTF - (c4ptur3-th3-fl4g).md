### Task 1: tradução & Shifting

traduzir, mudar e decode a sequência;

as respostas sao todas case sensitive

Para esse desafio, a maioria das questões foram resolvidas usando tradutores:

1. c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?

   Ah, um leet clasico (1337.

   > can you capture the flag?

2. 01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001

   se tem 0's e 1's significa que nós estamos lidando com binario.

3. MJQXGZJTGIQGS4ZAON2XAZLSEBRW63LNN5XCA2LOEBBVIRRHOM======

   esse eu achei que era base64, mas não foi, tentei no debaixo e foi, então pensei que poderia ser um base32 e realmente era.

   > base32 is super common in CTF's

4. RWFjaCBCYXNlNjQgZGlnaXQgcmVwcmVzZW50cyBleGFjdGx5IDYgYml0cyBvZiBkYXRhLg==

   esse eu sabia que era base64 e ajudou a descobrir o de cima.

   > Each Base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.

5. 68 65 78 61 64 65 63 69 6d 61 6c 20 6f 72 20 62 61 73 65 31 36 3f

   Tentei hexadecimal e foi, mas aparenta ser base16 tbm!

   > hexadecimal or base16?

6. Ebgngr zr 13 cynprf!

   esse foi mais dificil, mas sabia que tinha alguma coisa a ver com a mudança de sequencia de caracteres;
   fui pesquisar e descobrir que existe coisas do tipo ROT(numero) o numero sendo como ele rotaciona.

   > Rotate me 13 places!

7. \*@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX

    esse é rotação também, só que maior (rot47)

   > You spin me right round baby right round (47 times)

   esse foi o mais dificil usou várias criptografias (que vimos nos desafios anteriores).

   - Cifra 1: Base64
   - Cifra 2: Morse code
   - Cifra 3: Binary to ASCII
   - Cifra 4: ROT47
   - Cifra 5: BCD to ASCII

   > Let's make this a bit trickier...

### Task 2: Spectograms

espectonogramas são desenhos feitos com a representividade do som, uma onda se torna um formato 3d, assim possibilitando esconder algo numa onda sonora que aparenta não ter nada

1. depois do download

   Para esse desafio eu fiz o download do audacity, e coloquei no modo de visualizar spectogram, colocando isso a resposta ja aparece

   > Super Secret Message

### Task 3: Steganography

Esteganografia é a arte de esconder algo dentro de outra coisa
como esconder um arquivo .jpg dentro de um arquivo .mp4 ou etc.
esse desafio foi bem dificil pelo motivo de que não estava conseguindo fazer o download do steghide, mas achei uma variação dele o stegseek
fiz o comando e obti a resposta.

1. Decodificando a imagem para obter a resposta.

   Comando: `stegseek stegosteg_1559008553457.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

   usando o `stegseek`, a informação oculta foi para um arquivo .txt e dentro dele continha a flag.

   > SpachettiSteg

### Task 4: segurança atraves da escuridão

esse eu utilizei a tecnologia de um site: aperisolve.com

com esse site eu obtive acesso ao pcrt do arquivo onde continha a segunda resposta

1. usando o stegseek para ver o "verdadeiro" nome do arquivo:

   > hackerchat.png

2. De dentro do arquivo analisando com cuidado temos a segunda senha:

   > AHH_YOU_FOUND_ME!

## e com isso finalizamos um belo de um CTF.
